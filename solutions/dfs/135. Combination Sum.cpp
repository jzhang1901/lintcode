/* 
135. Combination Sum
Description 
Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.

The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak).
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example
Given candidate set [2,3,6,7] and target 7, a solution set is:

[7]
[2, 2, 3]

直觉上这道题有点类似于二叉树的的path sum 问题, 只是输入数据不是显式的树
