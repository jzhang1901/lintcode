Description

Design an iterator over a binary search tree with the following rules:

    Elements are visited in ascending order (i.e. an in-order traversal)
    next() and hasNext() queries run in O(1) time in average.

Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Example

For the following binary search tree, in-order traversal by using iterator is [1, 6, 10, 11, 12]

   10
 /    \
1      11
 \       \
  6       12

Challenge

Extra memory usage O(h), h is the height of the tree.

Super Star: Extra memory usage O(1)
